Hi there! I'm a computer science masters student with a background in low-level systems like-stuff such as
writing clang/llvm code transformers, reverse-engineering and computer graphics.

My current research deals with a combination of compartmentalization, tracing, and code transformation.

However, my interests expand to other fields such as machine learning, OS development, game development, virtual/augmented reality to complement my current endevours.

I plan to create projects that interleaves different fields to explore ideas people think would not be possible otherwise (pretty broad/cheesy..., but eh).

You can find research I've published on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GTX7CDMAAAAJ&hl=en) or take a look at my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) and [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) to see some interesting things that I've worked on :)
